# Chapel Logging!

A logging module supporting log levels, multiple output streams, and stack traces.  Helpful with debugging as it can tell you precisely what function is logging a particular statement.  Text output formatting is customizable and it's easy to guide particular messages to particular channels.
Can also be used as a general channel handler for regular runtime messages (use the RUNTIME run level).
